# Brain-MRI-Metastasis-Segmentation-Assignment
This repository implements a computer vision project for segmenting brain metastasis in MRI images using two advanced deep learning architectures: Nested U-Net (U-Net++) and Attention U-Net.  Key Features Data Preprocessing: Utilizes CLAHE to enhance MRI image contrast and visibility of metastases, with normalization and augmentation techniques.
